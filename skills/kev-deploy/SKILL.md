name: kev-deploy
description: Deploy a Kev decision model (the open Jev-style System One model) as the user's own TypeSafe-compatible HTTPS endpoint on Modal with one command, wire it into their code, and take it down. Use when someone wants to host Kev, get a Kev API URL, replace Jev / TypeSafe calls with a self-hosted model, pick a Kev size or GPU, add an API key, keep an endpoint warm, or stop and remove a Kev deployment.
license: Apache-2.0
compatibility: Requires Python 3.10+ and a Modal account (`pip install modal && modal setup`, free tier works for the small models). No GPU, no clone of the Kev repo, no Hugging Face account for the public checkpoints.

# Deploy Kev on Modal

`scripts/kev_serve.py` is a single self-contained Modal app. `modal deploy` on it builds an image with the kev package at
a pinned commit, loads a Kev checkpoint from the Hugging Face Hub on a GPU sized for it, and serves TypeSafe's System One
protocol (`POST /v1/systemone`, `GET /v1/models`) at `https://<workspace>--kev-api.modal.run`. It scales to zero when idle.
The file is short on purpose: if the user's case does not fit, read it and edit it.

## 1. Check the prerequisites

```bash
python3 -c "import modal" 2>/dev/null || pip install modal
modal profile current 2>/dev/null || modal setup      # opens a browser to sign in; the user must do this step
modal skills install -y                               # optional: Modal's own agent skill + docs (into .agents/, or -g for home)
```

If `modal setup` is needed, tell the user and wait; do not try to authenticate for them. `modal skills install` gives you
Modal's official skill and documentation, which helps with anything beyond this file: GPUs, secrets, volumes, logs, billing.

## 2. Pick the model

| `KEV_MODEL` | GPU (automatic; fallbacks in parentheses) | Cold start, measured 2026-09-23 (first ever / weights cached) | Idle cost | When |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `jaredpalmer/kev-0.8b` | L4 (A10G, L40S) | 77 s / 33 s | $0 (scales to zero) | cheapest, prototyping |
| `jaredpalmer/kev-4b` (default) | L4 (A10G, L40S) | ~2 min / 52 s | $0 | the default: best quality per dollar |
| `jaredpalmer/kev-9b` | A100-80GB (H100) | 128 s / 42 s | $0 | best released accuracy |

A warm container costs the GPU's hourly rate only while it is up (L4 about $0.80/h, A100-80GB about $2.50/h); after five
idle minutes it scales to zero. `KEV_MIN_CONTAINERS=1` keeps one warm (no cold starts, pays the hourly rate all the time).
Any Kev checkpoint on the Hub works (`you/kev-4b-support`, `repo@revision`); the GPU is picked by the name's size prefix
(`kev-4b...` -> L4), anything else gets an H100 unless `KEV_GPU` says otherwise. A private checkpoint needs `HF_TOKEN` at
deploy time; the file uploads `HF_TOKEN` as a Modal secret whenever it is set in the shell, so unset it for public ones.
Checkpoints fine-tuned with the `kev-finetune` skill deploy the same way once published.

## 3. Deploy

Always set an API key unless the user explicitly wants a public URL; without one, anyone with the URL can spend their
GPU time.

```bash
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaredpalmer/kev/main/skills/kev-deploy/scripts/kev_serve.py   # or use the skill's copy
export KEV_API_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 24)                # save it: it is the endpoint's bearer token
KEV_MODEL=jaredpalmer/kev-4b modal deploy kev_serve.py    # prints the URL
```

Settings are read at deploy time; redeploying with other values replaces the model behind the same URL.
`KEV_APP_NAME=kev-support` gives a second, independent endpoint (`https://<workspace>--kev-support-api.modal.run`).
`KEV_GPU=H100` overrides the GPU.

## 4. Verify

The first request after a deploy or an idle period waits for the cold start. Modal answers a request that waits longer
than 150 s with an HTTP 303 to a result URL, so warm the endpoint with a redirect-following call first:

```bash
curl -sL --max-time 900 $KEV_URL/v1/models -H "authorization: Bearer $KEV_API_KEY"   # returns once the model is loaded
```

```bash
curl -s $KEV_URL/v1/systemone -H "authorization: Bearer $KEV_API_KEY" -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{
  "state": "Order 4411 arrived late and the box was crushed. Two charges appear on my card.", "model": "kev-latest",
  "questions": {"team": {"type": "choice", "instructions": "Which team should handle this?",
                         "criteria": {"returns": "Exchanges, refunds", "shipping": "Delivery, delays", "billing": "Charges, payments"}},
                "urgent": {"type": "noul", "instructions": "Does this need urgent human attention?"}}}'
curl -s $KEV_URL/v1/models -H "authorization: Bearer $KEV_API_KEY"       # served checkpoint, base, temperature
```

Expect per-question `probabilities` (calibrated by the checkpoint's own temperature), `choice` / `noul` / `score`,
`latency_ms` (about 80-150 ms warm on an L4 for a short state). A request without the key must return 401.

## 5. Wire it in

The protocol is TypeSafe's, so only the base URL and key change:

```python
client = TypeSafeClient(api_key=KEV_API_KEY, base_url=KEV_URL, model="kev-latest")   # was: TypeSafeClient(api_key=TYPESAFE_KEY)
```

```ts
const r = await fetch(`${KEV_URL}/v1/systemone`, { method: "POST",
  headers: { "content-type": "application/json", authorization: `Bearer ${KEV_API_KEY}` },
  body: JSON.stringify({ state, model: "kev-latest", questions }) });   // question type "noul", not "boolean"
```

Kev answers typed questions about a state (Choice over named options, Noul yes/no, Score over ordered levels) without
generating text. It was trained on public classification, policy and rule data; on the user's own domain, measure it on a
few hundred labelled examples before relying on it, and if it falls short, fine-tune it with the `kev-finetune` skill.

## 6. Take it down

```bash
modal app stop kev            # or the KEV_APP_NAME used; the URL stops working immediately
modal volume delete kev-hf-cache   # optional: the cached weights (shared with kev-finetune; next deploy re-downloads)
```

## Troubleshooting

- **First request returns nothing or a 303**: the cold start is still running (weights download on the very first start,
  or Modal is still finding a GPU; `modal app logs kev` says "waiting to be scheduled"). Follow redirects (`curl -L`), use a
  longer client timeout, or deploy with `KEV_MIN_CONTAINERS=1`.
- **CUDA out of memory on start**: the GPU is too small for that checkpoint; use the table above or `KEV_GPU=H100`.
- **401 with the right key**: the key is fixed at deploy time; redeploy with the same `KEV_API_KEY` exported.
- **Logs**: `modal app logs kev` shows the load line (`serving <model> on <GPU> ... ready in Ns`) and every request.
